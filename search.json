By considering a wide range of different policy objectives in terms of extensive and intensive margins, we compute the returns to government spending for counterfactual policy schemes and credit market conditions.

    "text": "Capitalisation of Demand-side Policies with Information Asymmetries and Market Segmentation\nI consider the price capitalisation of demand-side policies in the context of segmented housing market with heterogeneous purchasers according to information level on the housing market. Empirically, I exploit the French policy which subsidise buy-to-let investments through tax cuts. To account for endogenous treatment assignment following a place-based policy design, I apply a difference-in-difference approach for successive policy removal and introduction. The segmentation definition I consider follows the one assumed by policymakers, i.e. according to tenure status and building type. Exploiting micro-data available from the tax register, I distinguish the price effect experienced by local purchasers (who are assumed to be perfectly informed and thus subject only to the demand-shifting channel) from that experienced by Out-Of-Town purchasers (with lower level of knowledge of the housing market). The findings indicate that i) subsidy is at least partly capitalised on the targeted segments ii) there is no effect on segment defined by owner-occupation iii) information asymmetries of OOT purchasers play a minor role to explain price increase (only 1 point).\nnew version coming soon"

    "text": "Spatial Sorting and Housing Wealth Persistence: Insights from the Universe of French Homeowners\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay, Julie Le Gallo and Olivier Dupré\nThis article studies the relationship between initial levels and subsequent changes in gross housing wealth. Using administrative microdata on housing ownership and transactions in France over the period 2011-2019, we impute a market value for all housing portfolios held by private homeowners. We document strong housing wealth persistence (HWP) for this population, particularly with respect to the location of the main residences. We then examine HWP for three sub-populations identified from the panel structure of our data. HWP appears to be mainly driven by homeowners who change their main residence or receive a housing inheritance, while it is less pronounced for homeowners with a constant housing portfolio. The spatial sorting operated by the location choices of main residences (both between and within commuting zones) appears to be a key determinant of HWP, rather than capital gains from price variations of given housing portfolios.\nversion available upon request"

    "text": "Winners and Losers: The Individual Consequences of Price Deviation on Capital Gains\nwith Antoine Peris and Laure Casanova Enault\nWe empirically assess how purchase price deviations affect the formation of housing capital gains. Making the best of the universe of transactions in France between 2012 and 2022, we first estimate an individual price deviation through a repeat sales approach with Heckman procedure to account for potential selection bias, controlling for experience in the housing market. Then, we regress realized capital gains on the individual deviation to assess the substitution between purchase price deviation and capital gains. Our results highlight that a 1 euro increase in purchase price decreases capital gains by 0.51 euro. We expect part of these individual deviations to affect the local housing market through future purchasers and sellers’ beliefs, leading to a mitigation of the capital gains differences.\nversion coming soon"
