It decreases with distance to center of metropolitan areas, following monocentric predictions.\nIn addition, Paris is the most expensive metropolitan areas, with Lyon and Lille as second best.\nTurning to the dynamic dimension, the spatial pattern changes dramatically. First, the metropolitan areas benefit from positive appreciation in average since 2011.\nSecond, the rural areas, with lower level of density experience either a stagnation of housing value, or a decrease. Hence, the gap between metropolitan areas and rural areas is increasing since 2011.\n[Spatial zoom]"

    "text": "Winners and Losers: The Individual Consequences of Price Deviation on Capital Gains\nwith Antoine Peris and Laure Casanova Enault\nWe empirically assess how purchase price deviations affect the formation of housing capital gains. Making the best of the universe of transactions in France between 2012 and 2022, we first estimate an individual price deviation through a repeat sales approach with Heckman procedure to account for potential selection bias, controlling for experience in the housing market. Then, we regress realized capital gains on the individual deviation to assess the substitution between purchase price deviation and capital gains. Our results highlight that a 1 euro increase in purchase price decreases capital gains by 0.51 euro. We expect part of these individual deviations to affect the local housing market through future purchasers and sellers’ beliefs, leading to a mitigation of the capital gains differences.\nsee paper"

    "text": "Capitalisation of Demand-side Policies with Information Asymmetries and Market Segmentation\nI consider the wealth accumulation resulting from potential price capitalization of policies stimulating buy-to-rent investments. I exploit multiple reforms of the French place based policy that stimulate buy-to-let investments through income tax cuts. To account for endogenous treatment assignment, I apply a Difference-in-Difference identification strategy using change in treatment assignment for specific municipalities that only affect eligibility to this policy. To uncover the underlying agents that benefit from the policy in term of wealth accumulation, I consider the housing market segmentation following the one assumed by policymakers, i.e. tenure status and building type. I also distinguish the price effect experienced by local purchasers (assumed to be perfectly informed) from that experienced by Out-Of-Town purchasers (with lower level of knowledge of the housing market). The findings indicate that i) the subsidy is at least partly capitalized on the targeted segments, leading to significant gains for developers and landowners ii) the policy repeal also increases the housing price for rented units in the existing demand due to shift in demand from subsidized to non-subsidized segment iii) owner-occupier experience no variations in their assets price iv) the price effect is symetrical between policy introduction and repeal.\nnew version coming soon"

    "text": "Spatial Sorting and Housing Wealth Persistence: Insights from the Universe of French Homeowners\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay, Julie Le Gallo and Olivier Dupré\nThis article studies the relationship between initial levels and subsequent changes in gross housing wealth. Using administrative microdata on housing ownership and transactions in France over the period 2011-2019, we impute a market value for all housing portfolios held by private homeowners. We document strong housing wealth persistence (HWP) for this population, particularly with respect to the location of the main residences. We then examine HWP for three sub-populations identified from the panel structure of our data. HWP appears to be mainly driven by homeowners who change their main residence or receive a housing inheritance, while it is less pronounced for homeowners with a constant housing portfolio. The spatial sorting operated by the location choices of main residences (both between and within commuting zones) appears to be a key determinant of HWP, rather than capital gains from price variations of given housing portfolios.\nversion available upon request"
