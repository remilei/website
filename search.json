The identification relies on the spatial and temporal variations of policy schemes over the last decade, controlling for endogenous treatment assignment by semi-parametric multi-level propensity scores. Our doubly robust estimations cannot rule out that the policy has no causal effect at the extensive margin, whereas it has significant effects at the intensive margin. Considering that policy makers value positively the extensive margin and negatively the intensive margin, we compute the returns on investment of government spending for counter-factual policy schemes and credit market conditions. Our simulations show that the current French policy is not cost-efficient for a wide range of monetary values of the two margins and cannot be improved by increasing overall budget cost.\nLatest version"

    "text": "Capitalisation of Demand-side Policies with Information Asymmetries and Market Segmentation\nI consider the price capitalisation of demand-side policies in the context of segmented housing market with heterogeneous purchasers according to information level on the housing market. Empirically, I exploit the French policy which subsidise buy-to-let investments through tax cuts. To account for endogenous treatment assignment following a place-based policy design, I apply a difference-in-difference approach for successive policy removal and introduction. The segmentation definition I consider follows the one assumed by policymakers, i.e. according to tenure status and building type. Exploiting micro-data available from the tax register, I distinguish the price effect experienced by local purchasers (who are assumed to be perfectly informed and thus subject only to the demand-shifting channel) from that experienced by Out-Of-Town purchasers (with lower level of knowledge of the housing market). The findings indicate that i) subsidy is at least partly capitalised on the targeted segments ii) there is no effect on segment defined by owner-occupation iii) information asymmetries of OOT purchasers play a minor role to explain price increase (only 1 point).\nLatest version"

    "text": "Spatial Sorting and Housing Wealth Persistence: Insights from the Universe of French Homeowners\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay, Julie Le Gallo and Olivier Dupré\nThis article studies the relationship between initial levels and subsequent changes in gross housing wealth. Using administrative microdata on housing ownership and transactions in France over the period 2011-2019, we impute a market value for all housing portfolios held by private homeowners. We document strong housing wealth persistence (HWP) for this population, particularly with respect to the location of the main residences. We then examine HWP for three sub-populations identified from the panel structure of our data. HWP appears to be mainly driven by homeowners who change their main residence or receive a housing inheritance, while it is less pronounced for homeowners with a constant housing portfolio. The spatial sorting operated by the location choices of main residences (both between and within commuting zones) appears to be a key determinant of HWP, rather than capital gains from price variations of given housing portfolios.\nversion coming soon"
