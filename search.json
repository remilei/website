    "text": "Submitted Paper\n\n\n\nSupporting Homeownership Cost-Effectively: Evidence from the French Interest-Free Loan Policy\n\nThis article estimates the causal effect of the French policy of subsidised loans both on the number of new homeowners (the extensive margin) and on housing choice and price distortions (the intensive margin). The identification relies on the spatial and temporal variations of policy schemes over the last decade, controlling for endogenous treatment assignment by semi-parametric multi-level propensity scores. Our doubly robust estimations cannot rule out that the policy has no causal effect at the extensive margin, whereas it has significant effects at the intensive margin. Considering that policy makers value positively the extensive margin and negatively the intensive margin, we compute the returns on investment of government spending for counter-factual policy schemes and credit market conditions. Our simulations show that the current French policy is not cost-efficient for a wide range of monetary values of the two margins and cannot be improved by increasing overall budget cost.\n\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay and Julie Le Gallo (submitted), link\n\n\n\nApports des Fichiers Fonciers enrichis pour analyser les patrimoines fonciers-immobiliers des individus\n\nDespite a spatially differentiated increase in property values in France since the beginning of the 21st century, the spatial dimension of the distribution of housing wealth remains understudied. The lack of empirical work is partly due to the absence of individual data, which is also available in a small number of countries -in Scandinavia, for example. To overcome this problem, we correct a structural error in the French property files used to measure housing wealth. We assess the quality of potential ID according to type I and type II errors. Our selected ID slightly introduce type I error, whereas significantly reduce type II error. Using this correction, we document the specialisation of the local ownership structure as a function of the observed price level. The proportion of dwellings owned by single owners (owners of a single dwelling) false significantly in the most expensive markets. In addition, the dynamics of ownership have changed over the last 10 years, with SCIs and legal entities gaining ground in the most expensive markets, to the detriment of single owners and multiple owners in their own right.\n\nwith Laure Casanova-Enault, Antoine Peris and Martin Bocquet (revise and resubmit to Revue d’Économie Régionale et Urbaine)\n\n\nWorking Paper\n\n\n\nPrice Capitalization of Demand-side Policies with Segmented Housing Markets\n\nI consider the price capitalisation of demand-side policies in the context of segmented housing market with heterogeneous purchasers according to information level on the housing market. Empirically, I exploit the French policy which subsidise buy-to-let investments through tax cuts. To account for endogenous treatment assignment following a place-based policy design, I apply a difference-in-difference approach for successive policy removal and introduction. The segmentation definition I consider follows the one assumed by policymakers, i.e. according to tenure status and building type. Exploiting micro-data available from the tax register, I distinguish the price effect experienced by local purchasers (who are assumed to be perfectly informed and thus subject only to the demand-shifting channel) from that experienced by Out-Of-Town purchasers (with lower level of knowledge of the housing market). The findings indicate that i) subsidy is at least partly capitalised on the targeted segments ii) there is no effect on segment defined by owner-occupation iii) information asymmetries of OOT purchasers play a minor role to explain price increase (only 1 point).\n\nlink\n\n\n\nSpatial Sorting and Housing Wealth Persistence: Insights from the Universe of French Homeowners\n\nThis article studies the relationship between initial levels and subsequent changes in gross housing wealth. Using administrative microdata on housing ownership and transactions in France over the period 2011-2019, we impute a market value for all housing portfolios held by private homeowners. We document strong housing wealth persistence (HWP) for this population, particularly with respect to the location of the main residences. We then examine HWP for three sub-populations identified from the panel structure of our data. HWP appears to be mainly driven by homeowners who change their main residence or receive a housing inheritance, while it is less pronounced for homeowners with a constant housing portfolio. The spatial sorting operated by the location choices of main residences (both between and within commuting zones) appears to be a key determinant of HWP, rather than capital gains from price variations of given housing portfolios.\n\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay, Julie Le Gallo and Olivier Dupré, draft coming soon\n\n\nWork in Progress\n\n\n\nInformation Asymmetries and Heterogeneous Uncertainty: Price Premiums on Housing Market\n\nWork in progress.\n\n\n\nOther Documents\n\nThe Dynamics of Property Ownership with Spatial Markets and Policies, PhD Manuscript, link"
